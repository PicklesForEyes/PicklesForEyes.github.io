            <h5 class="card-title">Early Life</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Born and raised in the south eastern corner of Durham, Benjamin spent most of his days playing outside with his brother, Greg, and neighborhood friends.  His parents strongly encouraged the young lad to play music as they had noticed his liking of his great grandfathers piano.  After a few years of piano lessons it was time to move onward and upward; he then played saxophone through middle school and picked up the French horn in high school.  This became his passion as he chose to persue it as a career field.</p>
            <h5 class="card-title">Current Life</h5>
            <p class="card-text">After a few years of a grueling music education degree, Benjamin had changed his mind on the career field he wanted to persue.  He decided to drop out and join the work force for a while as he looked for a new path.  That came to him after just a short year as he began dabbling in web development technologies.  After 6 months of self teaching he decided to attend The Coding Bootcamp at UNC Chapel Hill to grow his skill.</p>
